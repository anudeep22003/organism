I use bun for package management.


These are the coding principles to follow:
- Do not repeat yourself
- premature optimization is the root of all evil
- Introduce the minimum number of changes to achieve the desired task
- Code should be self-documenting, no comments unless necessary
- All names should be descriptive and meaningful and read like elegant prose in the stacktrace
- Use the most specific type possible, try your hardest not to use `Any`
- files should not be longer than 200 lines of code
